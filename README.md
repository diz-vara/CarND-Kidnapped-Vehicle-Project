This repository contains my (Anton Varfolomeev) solution for the 'Kidnapped Vehicle' project.

Command-line app may be called with single parameter - number of particles (10 by default),
so you can easily experiment and see that it is possible to achieve acceptable (but not so good) results even 
with 2 particles.
